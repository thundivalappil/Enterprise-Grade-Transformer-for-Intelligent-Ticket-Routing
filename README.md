# Enterprise-Grade-Transformer-for-Intelligent-Ticket-Routing
This project implements a production-ready Transformer-based NLP system for intelligent ticket routing. Designed with modular architecture, clean training and inference pipelines, and enterprise use-cases in mind, it demonstrates how modern Transformer encoders can be applied to real-world classification problems at scale.
